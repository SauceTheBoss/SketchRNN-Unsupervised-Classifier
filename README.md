# SketchAAE
Using AAE with SketchRNN

Get sketches from and put them in the 'sketches' folder:

[https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/sketchrnn](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/sketchrnn)
	
	
Review documentation about the sketches here, if needed:
